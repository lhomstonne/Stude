Installation:
-------------

0) Ensure Tomcat is stopped

1) Generate package with Maven

$ mvn package

2) Deploy the WebApp

Copy target/ShopItemSpringMVC.war to <CATALINA_HOME>/webapps

Unpack it in it's own directory (or Tomcat will do it at startup)

3) Install JDBC driver

Deploy database JDBC drivers to <CATALINA_HOME>/libs

- postgresql-9.3-1104-jdbc41.jar for Postgresql
- mysql-connector-java-5.1.36.jar for Mysql
- ojdbc.jar for Oracle

4) Install Datasource (2 options)

option 1 in webapp : Copy datasource context file doc/<database>/context.xml to <CATALINA_HOME>/webapps/ShopItemSpringMVC/META-INF

option 2 in tomcat : Copy datasource context file doc/<database>/ShopItemSpringMVC.xml to <CATALINA_HOME>/conf/Catalina/localhost

5) Start Tomcat with a commmand like :

$ $CATALINA_HOME/bin/catalina.sh run

6) Test DB connection with :

http://localhost:8080/ShopItemSpringMVC/test.jsp


DataSource options:
-------------------
maxTotal: Maximum number of database connections in pool. Make sure you configure your 
mysqld max_connections large enough to handle all of your db connections. Set to -1 for no limit.

maxIdle: Maximum number of idle database connections to retain in pool. Set to -1 for no limit.
See also the DBCP documentation on this and the minEvictableIdleTimeMillis configuration parameter.

maxWaitMillis: Maximum time to wait for a database connection to become available in ms, in this 
example 10 seconds. An Exception is thrown if this timeout is exceeded.  Set to -1 to wait indefinitely.
